Plant Identifying App (IOS/Transfer Learning Model)

Plan of action:
1. Train transfer learning model on plant images
2. Xcode will generate a swift class for our model when we import it
3. Will need to normalize picture before we pass it to model

** Need to define how we will connect back end to front **
- api end points
- http method = POST for images


Front end - Mia will work on over fall break
Transfer Learning Model - 
API Endpoints - 
Image Processing -
